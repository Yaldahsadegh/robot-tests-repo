# Robot Framework CI/CD Pipeline Example

This project demonstrates how to run Robot Framework tests using GitHub Actions. It includes:
- A simple test using SeleniumLibrary to check if the "Swag Labs" page loads correctly.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers tests on every push and pull request.
- The demo page (`swag_labs.html`) is hosted on GitHub Pages.
